# Dedication

This project is an homage to my parents.

From my dad—a methods analyst at Boeing—I absorbed rigor and precision by osmosis. That way of thinking shows up here: fixed-point angles, careful polynomial kernels, and the habit of reducing problems to fundamentals.

From my mom, I absorbed independence. She made it feel normal to choose my own path. I taught myself the tools and built this outside a formal program—but I know where the instincts and discipline came from.

Whatever skill is in this code, it’s theirs first. This is my way of saying thank you and keeping their ways of thinking alive in something useful.

*For Dad and Mom.*
